📌 Signals in Linux (To-the-Point Notes)

Signal = software interrupt sent to a process (like Ctrl+C).

Common signals:

	SIGINT → interrupt (Ctrl+C)

	SIGTERM → termination request

	SIGKILL → force kill (cannot be caught/ignored)

	SIGALRM → alarm timer

signal() → attach a custom handler function.

kill(pid, signal) → send a signal to a process.

👉 Interview Q: “Can we catch SIGKILL?”
No — only the kernel can kill with SIGKILL.
