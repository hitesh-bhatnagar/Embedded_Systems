TCP = like a phone call -> establish connection, reliable, ordered
UDP = like sending letters -> no connection, no gurantee, but very fast
Used in IoT, sensors, streaming, gaming where speed matters more than reliability

##		Key differences

	* No listen() or accept()
	* just sendto() & recvfrom()
	* servers just sits on aport and listens for messages
