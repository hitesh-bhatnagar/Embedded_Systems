Process = a running program in memory

When you run ./a.out, Linux creates a processs for it.

Each Process has a PID (process id)

You can see them with  'ps' or 'top' or 'htop'

fork()  => is a system call that creates a new process

	New process = child
	Original process = parent

	Both cont executing code, but their fork() return values differ:
		In child fork() returns 0
		In parent, fork() returns the child's PID
