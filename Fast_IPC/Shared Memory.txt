Shared memory allows multiple processes to access the same memory block 

	## This completely bypasses the need for the kernel to copy data, making it extremely efficient.
	## Very fast but needs synchronization

NOTE : 	Becoz multiple processes can write to the same location at the same time, it is highly prone
		to race around ditions and requries synchronization (eg: mutexes or semaphores) to ensure data integrity
