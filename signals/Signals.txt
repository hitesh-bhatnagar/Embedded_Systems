Signals are a way to communicate with processes (like interrupts in embedded systems)

	# Common Signals

	SIGINT   -> Sent when you press Ctrl+C
	SIGKILL	 -> Immediately kills a process (can't be caught/ignored)
	SIGTERM  -> Termination request (can be caught/handled)
	SIGCHLID -> Sent tp parent when a child terminates
